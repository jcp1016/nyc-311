Notes:
PUMAs (Public Use Microdata Aeas) - statistical areas created by the US Census Bureau to have approximately 100,000 residents.  There are 55 in NYC, numbered 03701 to 04114.  They can be used to represent groups of a few neighborhoods.  In NYC PUMAs do not cross borough boundaries.  Dataset availability:  1, 3, and 5-year ACS.

NTAs (Neighborhood Tabulation Areas) - statistical areas created by the NYC Department of City Planning for presenting and publishing census data.   The Census Bureau does not publish data for the NTAs.  NTAs are contained within PUMAs and do not cross PUMA boundaries.  Dataset availability:  2010 Census and 5-year ACS.

Census Tracts - statistical areas created by the US Census Bureau to have approximately 4000 residents.  There are over 2000 tracts within NYC.  Tracts are contained within NTAs and PUMAs and do not cross these boundaries.  You would aggregate tracts to create neighboroods since the tracts are relatively small.  Tract data published in the 5-year ACS can often have a large margin of error.  Dataset availability: 2010 Census and 5-year ACS.

Decennial Census:  a 100% count of the population taken every ten years, the latest being 2010.  

American Community Survey (ACS):  an annual survey of the population with values publsihed as estimates at a 90% confidence interval with margins of error for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year periods.  The number of variables is more extensive than the decennial census.  Includes socio-economic data like citizenship, educational attainment, income, occupation, home value, and much more.  Geographically more limited.  Areas with 65k residents ore more are published annually.  Areas with 20k residents or more are published as 3-year averages.  Areas with fewer than 20k residents are published as 5-year averages.
